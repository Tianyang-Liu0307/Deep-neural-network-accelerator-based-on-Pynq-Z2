# Deep-neural-network-accelerator-based-on-Pynq-Z2

The code references the runner-up entry in the 2020 DAC-SDC competition

I improved the parallelism in some parts of the code, and finally got a relatively satisfactory result
The whole process was refined and implemented in Vivado (HLS) 2018.3

Due to my relatively low qualifications, in vivado 2018.3, the wiring and timing constraints are not perfect enough, and the result obtained by the final TCL file may not be the optimal result.
